# Hackathon__Green_Campus_Simulator
The Hackathon project by Ren Yixiao and Yang Xikun. 
A strategy game aims to reduce carbon emissions in PolyU. 

## Game Settings
You lead the Campus Environment Management Department at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) with a three-year goal to reduce the schoolâ€™s carbon emissions as much as possible. 

Each month, you receive budgets to apply different environmental protection actions on campus.

**Various environmental actions differ in cost and effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions. You must choose the right actions at the best times to maximize savings and minimize emissions.**


## Game Rationality
The effectiveness of various environmental protection actions is supported by scientific evidence. 
1. **The dataset from PolyU**, which includes electricity consumption data from the CEE Department, along with supplementary data on the number of rooms, total air conditioners, and total electronic devices supplied by the university's Property Management Department, enables a comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions attributable to electricity use. These allow us to estimate carbon emission distribution within the campus precisely.
2. **Research papers are reviewed** to understand various environmental measures, which span multiple disciplines including computer science, civil engineering, and material science. These measures are not only accurate but also educational.
