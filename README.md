# Hackathon__Green_Campus_Simulator
The Hackathon project by **Ren Yixiao and Yang Xikun**. 
A strategy game aims to reduce carbon emissions in PolyU.

## Game Settings
You lead the Campus Environment Management Department at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) with a three-year goal to reduce the schoolâ€™s carbon emissions as much as possible. 

Each month, you receive budgets to apply different environmental protection actions on campus.

**Various environmental measures ('actions') differ in cost and effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions. You must choose the right actions at the best times to maximize savings and minimize emissions.**


## How To Play The Game


## Game Rationality
**Our game is supported by scientific evidence, and is educationally meaningful.** 

1. **We use the dataset from PolyU**, which includes electricity consumption data from the CEE Department, along with supplementary data on the number of rooms, total air conditioners, and total electronic devices supplied by the university's Property Management Department. **We make a comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions attributable to electricity use on our campus.**
2. **We review the research papers** to provide academic background for 'actions' in our game, which span multiple disciplines including computer science, civil engineering, and material science. **Our game is not only accurate but also educational. It helps players understand the effects and cost-effectiveness of different environmental measures.**


## Leaderboard System, PolyU GreenCoin System, and Our Main Purposes
**We plan to integrate this game with the GreenCoin system**, updating leaderboards regularly to spark competition and reward high achievers with GreenCoin points. GreenCoin points will also serve as entry tickets for our game. **We attempt to activate the GreenCoin system and achieve its expected goals.** 

Of course, our game also aims to enhance students' knowledge and awareness of environmental protection and carbon reduction. **Neither the game itself nor its integration with the GreenCoin system is the most important. We aim to use the game as a medium to promote the GreenCoin system, thereby contributing to create a truly green campus.**
